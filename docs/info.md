## How it works

The Phase Shifted PWM (PS-PWM) system generates phase-shifted PWM signals used for controlling power converters. The main module orchestrates the process by integrating various submodules. It starts by receiving and assigning inputs, then uses a shift register to process serial data, which determines control signals for selecting clock sources and phase-shifted triangular waveforms. These waveforms are generated by dedicated modules for different phases (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees). The system selects the appropriate phase for two channels and compares these waveforms with input data to produce raw PWM signals. Dead time generators add configurable delays to these signals to prevent transistor cross-conduction. Finally, an output multiplexer and enable control ensure the PWM signals are correctly outputted based on enable signals, producing the desired PS-PWM output.

## How to test

# 1. Initial Setup
- **Connect Power Supply:**
  - Ensure the module is powered correctly.
- **Clock Signal:**
  - Connect a function generator to the `clk` input.
- **Control Signals:**
  - Connect switches or signal sources for `rst_n`, `CLK_SR`, and `data_SR`.
- **Inputs:**
  - Connect `ui_in` and `uio_in` to signal sources like DIP switches or a microcontroller.

# 2. Reset the Module
- **Procedure:**
  - Set `rst_n` to low to reset the module.
  - Observe the module's outputs to confirm they reset.
  - Set `rst_n` to high to release the reset.

# 3. Shift Data into the Shift Register
- **Procedure:**
  - Set `data_SR` to the first bit of your 11-bit data (`1` or `0`).
  - Pulse `CLK_SR` high, then low to clock in the bit.
  - Repeat for each bit in your data sequence (e.g., `11'b00011001101`. Sequentially input each bit representing dt[0] to dt[4], SELECTOR_SIGNAL_GENERATOR_1[0], SELECTOR_SIGNAL_GENERATOR_1[1], SELECTOR_SIGNAL_GENERATOR_2[0], SELECTOR_SIGNAL_GENERATOR_2[1], OUTPUT_SELECTOR_EXTERNAL[0], and OUTPUT_SELECTOR_EXTERNAL[1] into the data_SR input. For each bit, you set data_SR to the corresponding value (1 or 0) and toggle CLK_SR high, then low, to clock in the bit. This sequential shifting ensures that each data_out corresponds to the specified comment name within the Shift_Register module.).

# 4. Configure `ui_in` and `uio_in` (example, 20% duty cycle)
- **Procedure:**
  - Set `ui_in` to `11010000` to set `d1 = 13` (d1 and d2 are 6 bit length, so 13/64 is about 20%).
  - Set `uio_in[3:0]` to `1101` to set part of `d2 = 13`.

# 5. Monitor Outputs
- **Procedure:**
  - Use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to check `uo_out` signals.
  - Verify the PWM signals on `uo_out[0]` (PMOS1), `uo_out[1]` (NMOS2), `uo_out[2]` (PMOS2), `uo_out[3]` (NMOS1), and the clock signal on `uo_out[4]`.
  - Confirm the PWMs duty cycle matches the expected 20%.
