## How it works

The Phase Shifted PWM (PS-PWM) system generates phase-shifted PWM signals used for controlling power converters. The main module orchestrates the process by integrating various submodules. It starts by receiving and assigning inputs, then uses a shift register to process serial data, which determines control signals for selecting clock sources and phase-shifted triangular waveforms. These waveforms are generated by dedicated modules for different phases (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees). The system selects the appropriate phase for two channels and compares these waveforms with input data to produce raw PWM signals. Dead time generators add configurable delays to these signals to prevent transistor cross-conduction. Finally, an output multiplexer and enable control ensure the PWM signals are correctly outputted based on enable signals, producing the desired PS-PWM output.
